# Satire Parodies

### Gonna be Gonna be BROKEN

*A series of parodies made for satirical purposes by Kayden, George, Ethan, Lion, and Arjun*

## Broken (parody of golden):

I was so rich, It was so sick, now

I’m so poor, with, no support

Given the loan, I didn’t know how to expend

All of the dough that was owed to me

I worked two jobs, tried to pay my debts

But I couldn't rent my own place

Called a homeless guy 'cause I got too high

Guess that’s why I’m not getting paid

<br>

Bada bum bum bum

I’m done livin’, time to give in, it’s my destiny

I’m sleeping hard in the homeless park and now I see

<br>

It’s goin' up, up, up, inflation’s growing

The housing market’s imploding

My credit score’s gonna be flowing

Oh, fuck fuck fuck here come the taxes

Running on, running on quicksand,

Gonna be, gonna be broke and, Now-

<br>

-ow I am hiding from my landlord cuz the rent is due,

My college debt will be all’s left

When I am fucking dead

<br>

Saved up so long to break these debts down,

Just to wake up under a tree

Place the chips all, in on red now

And I think that these casinos hate me,

<br>

I’m done livin’, time to give in, it’s my destiny

I’m sleeping hard in the homeless park and now I truly see

<br>

It’s goin' up, up, up, inflation’s growing

The housing market’s imploding

My credit score’s gonna be flowing

Oh, fuck fuck fuck here come the taxes

Running on, running on quicksand,

Gonna be, gonna be broke and Now-

<br>

-ow, I’m done whining, no more hiding, its not meant to be

Cause we are workers voices strong and I know Marx believes

<br>

You know we're gonna be, gonna be commies

It’s bound to be, bound to be

Gather in, gather in union,

A soviet union

You know that it's our time, no fears, no lies

That's who we're born to be

<br>
## Burn in Hell (Parody of Jingle Bells):

[Verse 1]

I’m surrounded by lies

My beliefs start wearing down

I walk around, wondering why

I won’t fucking die

Hell is made of rings

Making sinners cry

What fun it is to wail and sing

To my false god tonight

<br>

[Chorus]

Oh, burn in hell, burn in hell

Eternity awaits,

Oh, what fun it is to toil

In these blood-stained open gates, hey

Burn in hell, burn in hell

Inferno every day

Oh, what fun it is to live

A sinner’s painful fate

<br>

[Verse 2]

A year or two ago

I thought I'd spend a night

And now my lustful sins

Blow me out of sight

I’ve stolen all this food

From this homeless looking man

Well now I’m kind of screwed

In this frozen land

<br>

[Chorus]

Oh, burn in hell, burn in hell

Eternity awaits,

Oh, what fun it is to toil

In these blood-stained open gates, hey

Burn in hell, burn in hell

Inferno every day

Oh, what fun it is to live

A sinner's painful fate

<br>

[Verse 3 (DLC type verse)]

Bit by bit I took  

No lies I wouldn’t tell

Now I look in nooks

For money inside hell

I am a hateful dick

Anger’s my true way

I tried to fight in the river Styx

But got quickly washed away

<br>

[Chorus (DLC type Chorus)]

Oh, burn in hell, burn in hell

Eternity awaits,

Oh, what fun it is to toil

In these blood-stained open gates, hey

Burn in hell, burn in hell

Inferno every day

Oh, what fun it is to live

A sinner's painful fate

<br>

[Verse 4]

God is just a lie

I don’t believe in Christ

Well I was fucking wrong

I’m singing this shit song

The world is only white

Until I paint it red

I know it’s a crude sight

But complain and you’ll be dead

<br>

[Chorus]

Oh, burn in hell, burn in hell

Eternity awaits,

Oh, what fun it is to toil

In these blood-stained open gates, hey

Burn in hell, burn in hell

Inferno every day

Oh, what fun it is to live

A sinner's painful fate

<br>

[Verse 5 (DLC type verse)]

I love scamming kids

Don’t care about rules

Hell is kinda mid

Walking amongst fools

Backstabbing all my friends

I do it for self gain

Now hell is to no end

I’m Frozen full of pain

<br>

[Chorus]

Oh, burn in hell, burn in hell

Eternity awaits,

Oh, what fun it is to live

A sinner's painful fate

Oh, what fun it is to live

A sinner's painful fate

## Flat Earth Rock (Parody of Jingle Bell Rock):

Aliens, autism, end is soon nigh

Lizard men, spies and Obama’s high

Coverin’ the landing, on top of the moon

Now the whole world’s following their tune

<br>

Pyramids, martians, BlackRock too

Governments chime and give out jail time

Tanks are rolling in Tianmen Square,

It seems no one cares

<br>

What a bright time, it's the right time

To raid fifty-one today

The earth’s shaped like a big dime

Antarctica’s keeping us all at bay

<br>

You should know, what is up with covid vaccines

That is what Twitter decrees

Zuckerberg’s a lizard, with the rest of the elite

That's our oligarchy

<br>

CIA, FBI, and JFK

We all know that, they wanted him away

Everyone knows that the media’s wrong

They hit the pentagon

<br>

What a bright time, it's the right time

To release the Epstein files

Congress isn’t, giving us shite

And Trump hasn’t been spotted for miles

<br>

We know that Osama’s been meeting George Bush

Scheming around the clock

Mix and mingle in the fallen debris

Yeah, the government’s, yeah the government’s

Yeah, the government’s fucked

APPLAUSE

<br>

## Oh, This Generation Is Screwed (Parody of All I Want For Christmas Is You)

I don’t think a lot of the future

AI slop is all I see   !and!

I don’t care about the brand new Apple iphone seventeen

I just want a suburban home

A single game I actually own

Make my wish come true

Oh this generation is screwed

<br>

I don’t really need a degree, there is just one thing I need  !A job!

I’ll just write my application, with the help of GPT

I don’t need to spend my money on another subscription

Mr. Jeff won’t make me happy, with chopped item descriptions

<br>

I just want an apartment home

And internet that isn’t slow

Make my wish come true

Oh, this generation is screwed

!Screwed, baby!

<br>

Oh, there’s not much to like at Christmas, we won’t even get much snow   !WE’RE IN FUCKING CANADA! (FFF RUSH)

I’m just gonna keep on waiting for inflation to finally slow

I’ll just draft a resume and send it to the McDonalds   !I’m broke!

I will never stay awake to earn back my soul that I sold

<br>

‘Cause I just want some rent control

Can these mayors play their role?

What more can I do?

Oh, this generation is screwed

<br>

!Cooked, baby!

<br>

And, oh, all the kids are singing, thick of it and skibidi, !our brains all rot!

And the sound of children’s iPads fills the air Oh

And everyone is scrolling, I can hear my discord’s pinging

Buddy, won’t you bring me the beer I really need?

Won’t you please bring this world sanity?

<br>

Oh, I don’t think this life’s worth living, I can barely pay my rent

I just cannot see how this low, hourly wage will make a dent

<br>

Oh, all my personal info

Is being sold to Jeff Bezos

To make AI food

Oh, this generation is screwed

<br>

!Screwed, baby!

<br>

Oh, this generation is screwed !it’s true, baby!

Oh, this generation is screwed !and you, baby!

Oh, this generation is screwed !Where’s my food!  Shouted

Oh, this generation is screwed !Swiss cheese, baby!

Oh, this generation is screwed !We’re fucked dude! Stoner voice

Fat man, there’s no need to feel small, I said

Fat man, if you’re wide you’re tall, I said

Fat man, well you're in Murica

There's no need to be so leftist

Fat man, there's a booth you can go, I said

Fat man, when you put in your vote

You can

Vote now for daddy Donald Trump

And sell your soul to ICE

[Verse 3]

Thin man, I was once in your shoes, I said

I was one of the Demon-crats, I felt

Rich men should have to pay their tax

I felt that all men, should be treated fair,

That's when someone came up to me and said

"Thin man, get taken by ICE”

To a place owned by the MAGA

They can start you back on their way"

<br>

Overwork till dusk then speak in french to get a drink,

Insufferable you!

Mommy let you use her iPad, you were only two,

And it showed you the things that you weren’t supposed to do,

Now look at you! Look at you!

You’ve taken us down, your rot is out, oh how you grew…

And if we work together who knows what we’ll do,

It was always the plan, to put the blame in your hands.

<br>
## Better Than You (Parody of “Stronger Than You”):

This is Michael

Getting richer

And I can’t go bowing at the orders from the likes of you

Because I'm so much shorter

And I’m screaming, “bow to the new order”

<br>

Michael Lam doesn’t socialize with fools

I’m clearly above any of your petty rules

Let's go, ‘just’ me and you.

Let’s go, I’m better than you

<br>

Go ahead and bankrupt me if you’re able

Can’t you see that my finances are all stable?

I can’t see your face cause I’m under the table

But I know you’re mad ‘cause you’re disabled

<br>

You’re not gonna make me start growing mature

I ain’t gonna get my growth spurt ever

If you call me short well I know you’re gayer

And I’ll always be half the height that you are

<br>

I am Michael Lam,

I’m not Abraham

I am insecure

I’m better than you

<br>

I am Michael Lam,

I am the big man

I own all your land

I’m better than you

[Gap]

<br>

I own twenty cars

My butlers spit my bars

Wikipedia can back me

On my useless facts on trees

<br>

I am always seething

And I am never full

I won’t let you hurt my ego

My stomach‘s a black hole

<br>

Go ahead and mock me if you’re able

But I’ll blackmail you ‘til you’re rep’s unstable

Objecting to my opinion is a gamble

You’ll be subjected to a never-ending ramble

<br>

You’re not gonna win, my grades are better,

Once you’re proven useless, you’ll be severed,

With all the rumors, the group will fear me,

Don’t even try to fucking up me

<br>

I am THE

Mi-i-chael-Lam

Rii-ii-ich-chh

As shi-i-it

And its not abraham or kevin

Short as fu-u-uck

Full of Lu-u-uck

Making bu-u-ucks

You should know I’m better than you

Have your addresses

And your year old quotes

From grade se-e-ven

I am so far beyond you

Zero lo-o-ove

Now shut the fu-uck up

I am smart as fuck

And I’m better than YOU.

<br>
## Gay Way (Parody of My Way)

I’ve much, far too drunk beer

And so I face the doorway out

My door, I can’t speak clear

I think you’re gay, though you may doubt

And so, I must confess

I’m also gay, in a special way

And more, much more than that,

We might not be straight

<br>

Big bets, I've placed a few

But then again, zero broke even

I guess, that’s not so true,

You’ll understand, won’t you Steven? (The door)

I will, fully endorse

Free legal drugs, in the alleyway

But more, much more than this,

You should know that you’re gay

<br>

Yes, there were times, I'm sure you knew

When I jumped around like a kangaroo

But through it all, when there was doubt

I burnt it up and gave it a shout

I’ve said it all, and I’m sure as hell, that maybe you’re gay

<br>

I’ve jumped, I’ve fucking died

Every time my argument was losing

And now as shouts subside

I find it all, so confusing

To think I said all that

And apparently, not in a shy way

Oh, no, that’s just not me, I did it the, gay way

<br>

For what is a man, what has he got?,

If not other men, he must be distraught

Now he may say, what he truly feels

And say it in a high pitched squeal

The quotes now show

I now have chose

To do it the gay way

<br>

Oh yeah, it was the gay way

<br>
## Skyblock Grind Ruined Me(Parody of Internet Ruined Me)

My island’s like my brain

It’s got many parts and it’s a fucking mess

I don't know what is wrong with me

But I’m poor, bored, and sweaty

I have trouble speaking Japanese

Even though it’s my birth country (footnote: I was born in Canada)

Spend all my time grinding dungeons

This is the state that I'm in

<br>

My purse is just like my brain

Cause I’ve already lost half of it

I’m already gonna go insane

Just so I can get a couple more bits

It’s beauty, it’s grace

It has a high dps of least a 100k

I need to get more sky coins

To try and get Hyperion

<br>

But how am I broke?

I’ve spent the past ten years of my life

Grinding, it’s no joke

You're political enough but not contrary

It was tedious enough and not worth my time

Too much effort but I’ll still fail the climb

All the way to the top of Hypixel prime

Skyblock grind has ruined me

<br>

Look, I know I must sacrifice

But this is fucking ridiculous

If dungeons six ain’t enough

Then I really don’t know what is

I know I need seven floors

But a little hacks and I’d already be done with it

I’d have the big bucks, be the richest

I think I might be kinda masochist

Kinda masochist

<br>

But why do I fail?

When I’m monthly giving up fifty percent of my net worth?

It feels like my ideas of affection

It feels like my ways to achieve perfection

Are just a sink of my time and stability

I just want to be free

Skyblock has ruined me

<br>

I used to get REM sleep to recover

I used to get REM sleep to recover

I used to get REM sleep to recover

I used to get REM sleep to recover

I used to get REM sleep to recover

I used to get REM sleep to recover

I used to get REM sleep to recover

I used to sleep (not anymore)

<br>

## Mao Ze Dong is coming to town (Take a wild fucking guess)

You better not shout, you better not whine

About the CCP’s wonderful design

Mao Ze Dong is coming to town

<br>

He’s knows credit scores, and he’s farming your rice

He’s gonna dish out executions and glorious advice

Mao Ze Dong is coming to town

<br>

His enemies are a-weeping

He’s the great king of our state

He knows if you've been bad or good

So be good for China's sake

<br>

Oh, you better not riot, you better follow laws

You better not criticize the CCP’s cause

Mao Ze Dong is coming to town

<br>

He controls what you’re eating

He sees everything you see

He won’t hesitate to cut you down

So be good, be good I plead

<br>

You better not pout, you better not lie

About our great country’s prosperous design

Mao Ze Dong is coming to town
