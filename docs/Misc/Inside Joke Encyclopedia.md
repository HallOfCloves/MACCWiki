# Inside Joke Encyclopedia

### Random Referencing Pog

*A list of MACC inside jokes*

## Socially Acceptable

*Actually normal things to care about!*

!!! tip "Grrr"
    
    Jason Charisma accidentally said 'grrr' after screwing up a test and now we're all saying it

!!! tip "Old Man"

    Kayden is the oldest member in Gay Garlic so he’s practically older than the universe to the rest of us. Fourteen billion years and looks 100, quite an achievement.

!!! tip "George is Egg"

    At one point in grade 7, George was practically bald with a shiny forehead that made him look like an egg. So now that’s his nickname.
    He has his own theme song too" George is egg, egg is bad, let’s crack egg in a frying pan. Over medium heat with oil and salt, something something, idk

!!! tip "Ethan is Rat"
    
    In grade five Ethan discovered the wondrous song ‘We Don’t Talk About Rats’ and started a rat cult with fellow fifth graders Jonah and Akay (may be spelt wrong). Since then he has maintained an obsession with rats and has also created much lore surrounding the Haelborne Rats of the Holy City of Rattesse.

!!! tip "Strawberrypinkgarnet"
    
    The gang found out what Ruby’s email (strawberrypinkgarnet) was in grade 8 and found out how stupid she was when she was 10 years old. Since then she has been associated with strawberries, garnets, and strawberry shortcake (which is the name of this cartoon character that has a massive strawberry hat, which Ruby brought up herself). Ethan now calls her Berry for short.

!!! tip "George is Egg (when Michael says it)"

    Michael’s made his entire personality revolve around berating George, and that includes constantly reminding everyone that George looked like an egg. So it’s oversaturated and annoying now.

!!! tip "Ruby Sweeps Risk" 

    Ruby always wins Risk. Every bloody time.

!!! tip "Ethan Ruined the Environment"

    Ethan drove to the library to pick up the Daydream T-Shirts, and Kayden and George walked. The two of them caught Ethan leaving in his car and proceeded to call him out for not respecting the environment by using a vehicle. Ruby then proceeded to harass him with Lorax gifs about it while everyone else forgot.

!!! tip "Production TIMEEEEE"

    Ruby got hyperfixated on Neptune’s Pride and started to alert Ethan everything the production countdown decreases. This has resulted screenshots of the clock with that one rabbit watch meme, and this image which is now the image for the Neptune’s Pride GC"

!!! tip "Lion"

    We made a pun about Leo being Lion when he lied and now it's just stuck.

!!! tip "Hammy"

    Hammy is a sad hamster originating from the HammyCommunity. Ruby began proliferating it as a gif meme whenever she was sad.

!!! tip "Haaha :D"

    Because of Ruby and Hez’ generational beef, they would say Haaha to each other to emphasize when the other person makes a mistake. Now however, there’s different versions of Haaha. There’s Haaha (skill issue laugh), Haaha (Sad laugh), Haaha (Proud laugh), and Haaha (disappointed laugh).

!!! tip "Generational Beef"

    Ruby and Hez played some DEEP games that involved Hez cracking his watch and have since had some big disagreements, resulting in what Ruby calls generational beef. It’s now so intense that it’s become wagyu steak. Some beef includes Ruby making fun of Hez for getting one point less than her on the math test, Hez making fun of Ruby for not including a graph on a marketing write up, and trying to win tournaments on two player games very deep games.

!!! tip "What d'you think of popcorn?"

    After Ruby asked Ethan what he thought of popcorn for the second time after forgetting the original, it became a bit of an idiom for dementia.

!!! tip "Garfield Kart"

    Garfield Kart is objectively better than all other 'kart' games. It also can bring people back to life.

!!! tip "Smash Karts"

    Most important game.

!!! tip "Birthday Turtles"

    We used to draw turtles on the board for people's birthdays.

## Fucked Up

*You will get publically lampooned for saying these, but they're kinda funny.*


!!! tip "Green Alien Dog"

    Ruby brainrot.
